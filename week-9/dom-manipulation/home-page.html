<!-- Add your reflection here 
Reflection:

What did you learn about the DOM?

I learned that DOM is not too difficult to manipulate if you know the proper JS syntax.
I also learned that repeated tags, classes, etc. can be accessed in a manner similar to indexes in
an array.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

Some useful methods for manipulating the DOM are .querySelect and .querySelectAll, which will select the first element by tag, class, id, or name, or all of them with querySelectAll.
