		- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
		We thought it was good to get real working experience on coding things like images and links, as well as page layout issues that we ran across. Adding links and images to a real site is more fulfilling than messing around on a temporary page that nobody will see.

		- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
		We found it to be relatively straight-forward, since html is very ubiquitous, and the resources available are nearly unlimited. We generally knew what we wanted to achieve, the only thing to be researched was the exact tags/attributes to make it work as intended.

		- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
		It's been drilled into our heads over the course of the past five assignments and various video tutorials to not mess with formatting in HTML, so it was easy to remember not to do so. We both understand the importance of keeping the parent and child lines of code tidy in order to make visual sense to an outside observer, so that was something that came naturally.

		- What seems good and bad about HTML?
		We found HTML to be easy to understand and implement, its syntax is fairly simple by design. This is especially true when you're attempting to make a more basic webpage without any frills. On the flipside of that, because HTML is so basic, it can't be used to create more advanced or aesthetically pleasing sites.


		- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
		All of the tags are fairly easy to remember because they essentially explain what they do via shorthand (i.e., it's easy to remember that <p> refers to a new paragraph). The key is remembering what attributes are associated with which tags, but again the tag shorthand makes it easy to make that association.
