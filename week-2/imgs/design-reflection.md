### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of web design are:
1. Information Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to essentially tell people about myself, which includes picture(s) of me, a link to my blog, facebook, twitter, and projects I've worked on or am working on.

### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience would most likely be interested in learning about me and what kinds of things I can do, and how I like to do them. I plan on injecting my own interests into the site, maybe adding elements of movies or gaming into it, in order to show parts of myself not just in long expository text, but in a visual way as well.

### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I think it will depend on the person visiting the site. If it's a potential employer, I would like them to see my projects and be able to find out how to contact me. If I'm using it like a business card for someone I've just met, they can search for information to learn a little bit more about me personally. And if they're a fellow developer, I'd also like them to see my portfolio, maybe for feedback and links to my GitHub so I can share my source code.

### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

User experience is good to consider, but user experience will vary from person to person, because of the obvious fact that what one person feels about a website's design won't be the same as another person's feelings about that same design. Also, one website's user experience won't necessarily exactly translate to another website. Essentially, a user experience has to be tailored to what a site is looking to accomplish.

### What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is designing a site around how a person feels when interfacing with that site. It's valuable because taking into account and addressing how a person feels when they use the site will directly affect things like repeat uses, duration of use, and if the site is a commercial one, how much money they may spend.

### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I actually enjoyed the creation of all of the different pages, inserting the image, and linking the pages. Funny enough, I found writing the content the most tedious, which I suppose is the Information Gathering and Planning stages of the design.
