      Hey everyone! So if this is all new to you, don't worry, it's definitely new for me too. I've never used any kind of version control or code storing (when would I need to!?). But I've learned so much in this first week already, and I'm excited to dig into more.

        The biggest concepts we delved into in our first course unit is the idea of <em>version control</em>.

        The key take away of version control is the fact that it's a method to keep you from screwing yourself over by introducing bugs or code that isn't ready, and overwriting all your previous hard work. It's basically a system of gating to make you slow down and not be a complete idiot.

        Not only that, but if you *were* to introduce a bug, version control allows you to go back to previous versions before you made any mistakes.

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used the DOCTYPE, html, head, title, and body tags most often because they are a requirement for any html document.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements are laid out on the page in a hierarchical order, with the most crucial elements coming first. They signfy the fact that it's html and give important page information. Later on, the body is introduced generic information is given to the user, through text layouts and imagery, and more specific elements.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

We learned about the ability to indent multiple lines at once, and how to create and use snippets. We both would definitely use snippets in the future, they are clearly a great way to improve efficiency. Researching existing shortcuts would be extremely beneficial as well to streamline the process of coding.
