### How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Using Chrome's DevTools, you can format or position elements by directly altering the css to add or change position, margin, padding, etc.

### How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can resize an element on the DOM using CSS by altering the width and height of elements.

### What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static - Static is the default setting for position, and does not need to be set. Static is when one block level element sits on top of the next.
Absolute - With position set to absolute, the default of one block element on top of the next no longer applies. The element that has its position set to absolute will no longer affect other elements of the page, meaning that other elements won't be moved or pushed around the page by that block.
Fixed - Fixed is fairly simple in that it essentially locks the element to its current position in the page, making the element follow the user when scrolling.
Relative - Relative positions an element in relation to where it would have been normally, meaning that you can use it to make adjustments. 

### What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

All content (text or images) have an invisible box around it. Therefore, padding is the space between the content and the perimeter of this box, the border represents the width of the outside of the box, and the margin is the space around the outside of the border, between the box and the outside of the page.

### What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I actually liked this challenge much more than the previous one. I found this one much more straightforward and more clearly demonstrating the concepts of position, margin, and alignment. It gave me hope and excitement for my current and future websites, where the previous challenge seemed to be an exercise in frustration. I'm anxious to try
