###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

It may be a little difficult to grok at first, given the various steps and steep learning curve with the vocabulary, but once you understand that it's just a move from an online resource to your local computer, it becomes much easier to understand.

The first step is to go to your repositories, then click 'New Repository.' Enter the new repository you made, then copy the url from the text box on the right-hand side of the page. From there, go to your command line, and type 'git clone' and paste the url you copied. Now the repository is on your computer. 

###Describe what open source means.

Open source is the philosophy of allowing anyone to use your source code, and vise versa.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source is a very idealistic and noble philosophy, and one that I support. The implementation of licenses protects any intellectual property associated with your code, so even making code public can come with a reasonable assumption of the safety of your code from someone using it as their own.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.

Obviously, licenses are incredibly important, and it's part of what makes open source work. As stated above, the use of licenses allows you, the developer, to determine exactly what others can do with your code. So you can contribute your code to open source without fear of it being used in ways you didn't intend or to be distributed without crediting its author.

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge really crystalized the moving of files and directories between my local work space and the online repository on GitHub. I think just working through it a few more times with new examples gave me more confidence in the process and allowed me to see it from other angles.

###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found a list of basic git bash commands for Windows, as well as a discussion board that helped better visualize the git change stages.
