# 1.1 Think About Time

I learned about the Pomodoro and Fogg Techniques. I knew about the principles of Pomodoro, but to have it simplified gave me the motivation to try it more often in my life. Time Boxing is similar to Pomodoro, although it's more about setting a period of working time that's realistic, and reviewing what you got done, rather than setting a task you'd like to get done, and seeing how long it takes. I'll plan on using that to avoid burnout in Phase 0 and beyond by giving myself permission to take breaks regularly.

Honestly, at the moment I have no real time management strategy, and have never really had one. I often feel as if I have low-level ADD and can't focus. It's definitely not working and makes me feel like there's something wrong with me when I can't be productive.

I think I'm most excited about the Fogg Technique. It's such an obvious idea, but one that I'd never thought of before. It's the exact same way that I started going to the gym and taking better care of myself, just by employing minor habit changes (biking to work one day a week becoming biking to work at least four days a week).

My plan is to try and determine how long each assignment/challenge will take me, and break up my week into blocks of productivity and rest, which will teach me some good habits later on in Phase 1, and keep my stress levels low.

# 1.2 The Command Line

1. A shell is a user interface for interacting with an operating system. Bash is a type of shell, which stands for Bourne Again Shell, due to it's updating of the earlier 'Bourne' shell, and it is the default shell for Linux and OSX operating systems.

2. The part I found the most challenging were the redirect, indirect, and pipes. While most of the commands are straightforward because they basically describe what they'll do in the command themselves, input/output redirects aren't so self-explanatory, and require to really think about what you're asking for and what the shell is interpreting.

3. I was able to successfully use all the commands after some experimentation, but it was really interesting bridging the gap in my very basic knowledge of interacting with a CLI (DOS).

4. I find that the most important commands to know are the most simple: the ones that allow you to actually navigate directories and files. So I would say that the most important are 'cd,' 'pwd,' 'ls,' and the commands to let you read files, like 'more,' 'less,' and 'cat.' The 'help,' 'man,' and 'apropos' commands are also invaluable if you're stuck.

5.

pwd - print working directory. This shows the full directory that you're currently in.
ls - This provides a list of information about a file, and also displays files and directories that are in the directory specified.
mv - This command is used to move and rename files.
cd - This changes directories.
../ - This command is used to move up a directory.
touch - touch is used to create temporary files, and can also change time stamps on files.
mkdir - This is used to create new directories.
less - This command displays text one screen at a time, which is often more useful than cat or more, which prints the entire file.
rmdir - The opposite of mkdir, this removes directories.
rm - Removes files.
help - Similar to man, this displays help for commands.
